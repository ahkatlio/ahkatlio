- ðŸ‘‹ ###Hello there, my fellow human.
###My name is Abdullah Al Omar Galib 

#### Iâ€™m an investigator, a detective whose work is to solve the mystery of this universe.

Man is all his intellect; events are the fundamental elements of ourselves. Events made me the person Iâ€™m right now. Sometimes, those events were promising, sometimes they were not. However, these are the reasons that made me an adventurer, a detective, and a wanderer. I have coped with lots of difficulties as other adventurers did. But the process of my evolution makes me unique and extraordinary from the other adventurers. The way I deal with the worst circumstances is a glimpse of my evolutionary strategy. The best way to deal with an ominous crisis is to comprehend the situation. It always helps. But, for that, I have to be very decisive and open-minded. Perseverance is the prominent key to achieving decisiveness. For this, I need extreme persistence to achieve something satisfactory, and the best way to do that is to complete the quest in time. I wonâ€™t rest until Iâ€™ve accomplished my ambition. Iâ€™m inquisitive nevertheless concentrated, imaginative yet decisive, and enterprising nevertheless confidential. Which characterizes me as a unique segment of the cosmos. Iâ€™m an investigator, a detective whose work is to solve the mystery of this universe. To solve the enigma, I also need to understand its process. The best way to interpret it is to create a cipher of my own. However, I also like to draw and write poems. I post them on my YouTube channel.
